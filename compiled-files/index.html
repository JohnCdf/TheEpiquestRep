    <!-- if you are confused about where all the HTML elements went to, this will explain.

  Below this comment there is a div named "root",
  and below root there are scripts being linked
  the first link is the main script
  inside it i have written the HTML elements to be rendered.

  So to answer your question "Where did all the elements go?"

  All of the elements are inside elements.js

  Now your question must be "Why" or "How"?

  Why? Because maintainability

  How?
  That is the correct question
  I did it through ReactJS,

    Inside /src/ there are new files, inside these files is ReactJS that I compiled with webpack, that is why there is also a new webpack.config.js - it's like gulpfile.js but for webpack.

      When webpack compiles the code, it takes all of the ReactJS code I put together and turns into /src/elements.js

  So that after linking "elements.js" into the body, I put the rest of the scripts so there are no problems, like maingame.js not finding any elements.

  +++Do not move any of the script tags+++

  I hope this explanation helped
